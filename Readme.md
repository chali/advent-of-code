# Advend of code

You can help Santa with Christmas with your programming skills. http://adventofcode.com

I use this competition as my language playground.

Days 1-22 from 2015 are done in Scala. I would like to try Kotlin so I will continue from day 23 in Kotlin.

NOTE: I had to split scala and kotlin into separate submodules because issue with testing frameworks. There was some kind of
conflict and kotlin tests were ignored.
